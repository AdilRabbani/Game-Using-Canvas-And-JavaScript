            <span>My name is Adil Rabbani.I want to be a game developer and thats the only reason i enjoy assignments/projects<br>
                  that involve making games.In each of the semester I try to learn new things in game development. This game<br>
                  is an example of how i can make an exact replica of a previously made game and on a different platform. <br>
                  Nothing has been taken from the internet apart from the tutorials that i watched to get familiar with the <br>
                  Canvas and JavaScript on HTML.<br>
